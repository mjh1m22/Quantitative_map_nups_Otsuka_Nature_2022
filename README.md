# Source code for Nups intensity quantification for Otsuka et al. Nature_2022
This source code extracts distributions of nups intensity on nulear surface in core and non-core regions. This was partly developed for the manuscript "A quantitative map of nuclear pore assembly reveals two distinct mechanisms" by Otsuka et al. Nature 2022 which is under publication. A biorxiv version of the manuscript is available at doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.17.444137
## Requirements
The code has been tested on the following versions. Previous versions of MATLAB may also work:
MATLAB 2022a
Bioformat for MATLAB (http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.3.4/)
