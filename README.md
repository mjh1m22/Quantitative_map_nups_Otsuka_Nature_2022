# Quantitative_map_nups_Otsuka_Nature_2022
This source code extracts distributions of nups intensity in core and non-core regions. This was developed to quantify different nups for the manuscript below: Otsuka "A quantitative map of nuclear pore assembly reveals two distinct mechanisms" doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.17.444137
# Requirements
